# Aquaculture Model

Python model to predict oxygen concentration in aquaculture sea cages.

A working version of the model can be found her:

## About
The model is based on results and observations from the Ph.d. thesis by H. Bergsson, University of Copenhagen, Marine Biological Laboratory.

It calculates the expected oxygen available in a sea cage at given temperature and salinity. The novelty of the model, lies in that it includes the respiratory physiology of the fish.

The model is implemented in Flask.

The webapp enables quick assessment of sea cage conditions.
